# Predicting Flight Prices using Machine Learning

## Step 1: Getting Started
I started by working on a project to predict flight prices using machine learning. To do this, I needed a bunch of information about flights, like when they leave, when they arrive, the dates, the class you're flying in (like economy or business), and how long the flight is.

## Step 2: Understanding the Data
I looked closely at the information I had about flights. I wanted to see if there were any patterns or interesting things in the data. This part is like detective work â€“ trying to find clues in the numbers.SO i do some explanatory analysis(EDA) about this dataset.

## Step 3: Making the Models
Next, I used different ways of doing the math to predict flight prices. It's like trying out different tools to see which one works the best. I tried simple methods and more complicated ones to find the best way to predict prices.I tried several models like Linear Regression, Random forest regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Kneightbourforest to see that which model gives me the accurate result. 

## Step 4: Checking How Good the Models Are
After making the models, I needed to check if they were doing a good job. I used some special tests to see how close my predictions were to the actual prices. This is important to make sure the predictions are accurate.

## Step 5: Saving the Best Model
Once I found the best way to predict prices, I saved all the information about it. It's like taking a picture of the best tool I found so I can use it later.

## Step 6: Making it Easy for Everyone
To make it easy for people to use my predictions, I created a simple app using a tool called Streamlit. This app lets you input details about your flight, like when you're leaving and arriving, and it gives you a prediction of how much your flight might cost.

## Conclusion: Bringing it All Together
So, in simple terms, I worked on a project to figure out how to predict flight prices. I looked at a lot of data, tried different ways of predicting, and finally, I made a simple app that anyone can use to get an idea of how much their flight might cost. It's like having a little helper for planning your trips!
